Without Butano engine, I couldn't have come this far.
Thanks for developing this awesome engine, GValiente!

Developer's comment

Yay!  This is my first Game Jam Entry ever!
It's still in a demo phase, and only has 3 levels available for now,
but I'm still happy to release my first-public-game-ever!

Without the help of people on the gbadev discord server, this wouldn't be possible.
Thanks for all of you!

In this demo, only 25% of what I planned is implemented.
I wanted to make more symbols and more gimmicks for the platforming,
but as it's my first game ever, it took way more time than I expected,
so that I can't have them all.

Anyways, thanks for checking out this game, I hope you have a great time!
